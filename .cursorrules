# Cursor Project Rules

# Commenting
- Do not add code comments unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- Add doc strings to type definitions to improve intellisense.

# Structure
- One class per file.

# Style & Types
- Preserve existing indentation (tabs vs spaces) and width for all edits.
- Avoid introducing any uses of `any`; prefer `unknown` or concrete types.
- Prefer clarity and readability; follow the codebaseâ€™s existing formatting.
